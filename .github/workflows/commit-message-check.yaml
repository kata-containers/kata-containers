        # Notes:
        #
        # - The subject line is not enforced here (see other check), but has
        #   to be specified at the start of the regex as the action is passed
        #   the entire commit message.
        #
        # - Body lines *can* be longer than the maximum if they start
        #   with a non-alphabetic character.
        #
        #   This allows stack traces, log files snippets, emails, long URLs,
        #   etc to be specified. Some of these naturally "work" as they start
        #   with numeric timestamps or addresses. Emails can but quoted using
        #   the normal ">" character, markdown bullets ("-", "*") are also
        #   useful for lists of URLs, but it is always possible to override
        #   the check by simply space indenting the content you need to add.
        #
        # - A SoB comment can be any length (as it is unreasonable to penalise
        #   people with long names/email addresses :)
