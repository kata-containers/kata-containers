  This file contains version details that are used by various
  repositories for setting up the correct environment to run
  tests and package components.

format: |
  Each entry in this file MUST conform to the following format:

  <group>:
   description: "<brief-description>"
   notes: "<notes>"

   <project>:
     description: "<brief-description>"
     notes: "<notes>"
     url: "<project-url>"
     issue: "<bug-url>"
     commit: "<commit>"
     version: "<version>"
     uscan-opts: "<optional uscan options>"
     uscan-url: "<url regex for uscan to list versions>"
     release: "<version>"
     branch: "<git-branch>"
     meta:
       <key-1>: "<value-1>"
       <key-n>: "<value-n>"

  Notes:

  - All sections (except "meta") MUST include a description where
    applicable. This is expected to be a brief summary.

  - A section MAY specify a "notes" section which may be multi-line.
    It is expected to be expand on the information specified in
    "description".

  - All sections (except "meta") MUST include a URL where applicable.

  - A section MAY specify a bug URL using the "issue" field.

  - A section MAY define a "meta" section to store additional
    information about a project or group.

  - Each entry MUST specify ATLEAST one of "commit", "version", "release"
    and "branch".

  - WARNING: Gotcha alert! Remember to double-quote all strings
    (except multi-line strings)! This avoids the possibility of a
    version containing a period being treated as a floating point
    number (and truncated!)

  - NOTE: For the uscan related entries, refer to the following uscan pages:
    https://manpages.debian.org/stretch/devscripts/uscan.1.en.html
    https://wiki.debian.org/debian/watch
    Particularly note the 'Common mistakes' section.
    Also note, if you place the uscan strings on single lines in this file then
    '\'s need to be '\'d, so are replaced with '\\', but this does not apply
    for '>-' multi line entries, which can then use the normal uscan syntax.
