  This file contains version details that are used by various
  repositories for setting up the correct environment to run
  tests and package components.

format: |
  Each entry in this file MUST conform to the following format:

  <group>:
   description: "<brief-description>"
   notes: "<notes>"

   <project>:
     description: "<brief-description>"
     notes: "<notes>"
     url: "<project-url>"
     issue: "<bug-url>"
     commit: "<commit>"
     version: "<version>"
     release: "<version>"
     meta:
       <key-1>: "<value-1>"
       <key-n>: "<value-n>"

  Notes:

  - All sections (except "meta") MUST include a description where
    applicable. This is expected to be a brief summary.

  - A section MAY specify a "notes" section which may be multi-line.
    It is expected to be expand on the information specified in
    "description".

  - All sections (except "meta") MUST include a URL where applicable.

  - A section MAY specify a bug URL using the "issue" field.

  - A section MAY define a "meta" section to store additional
    information about a project or group.

  - Each entry MUST specify ATLEAST one of "commit", "version" and "release".

  - WARNING: Gotcha alert! Remember to double-quote all strings
    (except multi-line strings)! This avoids the possibility of a
    version containing a period being treated as a floating point
    number (and truncated!)
