#
# Notes:
#
# - Tracing is ONLY enabled when `enable_tracing` is set: explicitly
#   setting `trace_mode=` and/or `trace_type=` without setting `enable_tracing`

# Internetworking model
# Determines how the VM should be connected to the

# Options:
#
#   - bridged (Deprecated)
#     Uses a linux bridge to interconnect the container interface to
#     the VM. Works for most cases except macvlan and ipvlan.
#     ***NOTE: This feature has been deprecated with plans to remove this
#     feature in the future. Please use other network models listed below.
#
#
#   - macvtap
#     Used when the Container network interface can be bridged using
#     macvtap.
#
#   - none
#     Used when customize network. Only creates a tap device. No veth pair.
#
#   - tcfilter
#     Uses tc filter rules to redirect traffic from the network interface
#     provided by plugin to a tap interface connected to the VM.

# If enabled, the runtime will not create a network namespace for shim and hypervisor processes.
# This option may have some potential impacts to your host. It should only be used when you know what you're doing.
# `disable_new_netns` conflicts with `enable_netmon`
# `disable_new_netns` conflicts with `internetworking_model=bridged` and `internetworking_model=macvtap`. It works only
# with `internetworking_model=none`. The tap device will be in the host network namespace and can connect to a bridge
# (like OVS) directly.
# If you are using docker, `disable_new_netns` only works with `docker run --net=none`
# (default: false)

# if enabled, the runtime will add all the kata processes inside one dedicated cgroup.
# The container cgroups in the host are not created, just one single cgroup per sandbox.
# The sandbox cgroup is not constrained by the runtime
# The runtime caller is free to restrict or collect cgroup stats of the overall Kata sandbox.
# The sandbox cgroup path is the parent cgroup of a container with the PodSandbox annotation.
