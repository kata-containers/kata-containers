## Hypervisors Integration

  Currently supported hypervisors with Kata Containers include:
- `qemu`
- `cloud-hypervisor`
- `firecracker`

   In the case of `firecracker` the use of a block device `snapshotter` is needed
   for the VM rootfs. Refer to the following guide for additional configuration
   steps:
   - [Setup Kata containers with `firecracker`](how-to-use-kata-containers-with-firecracker.md)
- `ACRN`

  While `qemu` , `cloud-hypervisor` and `firecracker` work out of the box with installation of Kata,
  some additional configuration is needed in case of `ACRN`.
  Refer to the following guides for additional configuration steps:
- [Kata Containers with ACRN Hypervisor](how-to-use-kata-containers-with-acrn.md)
