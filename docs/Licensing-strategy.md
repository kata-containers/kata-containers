# Licensing strategy

* [Project License](#project-license)
* [License file](#license-file)
* [License for individual files](#license-for-individual-files)      

## Project License

The license for the [Kata Containers](https://github.com/kata-containers)
project is [Apache 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

## License file

All repositories in the project have a top level file called `LICENSE`. This
file lists full details of all licences used by the repository.

## License for individual files

Where possible all files in all repositories also contain a
[SPDX](https://spdx.org) license identifier. This provides fine-grained
licensing and allows automated tooling to check the license of individual
files.

This SPDX licence identifier requirement is enforced by the
[CI (Continuous Integration) system](https://github.com/kata-containers/tests/blob/main/.ci/static-checks.sh).
