# Kata Containers boot time metrics
The boot time metrics test takes a number of time measurements through 
the complete launch/shutdown cycle of a single container. From those 
measurements it derives a number of time measures, such as: 
- time to payload execution 
- time to get to VM kernel
- time in VM kernel boot 
- time to quit 
- total time (from launch to finished)

## Running the test
Boot time test can be run by hand, for example: 
``` 
$ cd metrics 
$ bash time/launch_times.sh -i public.ecr.aws/ubuntu/ubuntu:latest -n 1
```
