# FIO in Kubernetes

This test run `fio` jobs to measure how Kata Containers work using virtio-fs DAX. The test works using Kubernetes.  
The test has to run in a single node cluster, it is needed as the test modifies Kata configuration file. 

The `virtio-fs` options that this test will use are: 

* `cache mode` Only `auto`, this is the most compatible mode for most of the Kata use cases. Today this is default in Kata. 
* `thread pool size` Restrict the number of worker threads per request queue, zero means no thread pool. 
* `DAX` 
``` 
File contents can be mapped into a memory window on the host, allowing the guest to directly access data from the host page cache. This has several advantages: The guest page cache is bypassed, reducing the memory footprint.  No communication is necessary 
to access file contents, improving I/O performance. Shared file access is coherent between virtual machines on the same host even with mmap. 
``` 

This test by default iterates over different `virtio-fs` configurations.

| test name                 | DAX | thread pool size | cache mode |
|---------------------------|-----|------------------|------------|
| pool_0_cache_auto_no_DAX  | no | 0 | auto | pool_0_cache_auto_DAX | yes | 0 | auto |

The `fio` options used are: 

`ioengine`: How the IO requests are issued to the kernel. 
* `libaio`: Supports async IO for both direct and buffered IO. 
* `mmap`: File is memory mapped with mmap(2) and data copied to/from using memcpy(3). 
`rw type`: Type of I/O pattern. 
* `randread`: Random reads. 
* `randrw`: Random mixed reads and writes. 
* `randwrite`: Random writes. 
* `read`: Sequential reads. 
* `write`: Sequential writes. Additional notes: Some jobs contain a `multi` prefix. This means that the same job runs more than once at the same time using its own file.

### Static `fio` values:
Some `fio` values are not modified over all the jobs. 
`runtime`: Tell `fio` to terminate processing after the specified period of time(seconds). 
`loops`: Run the specified number of iterations of this job. Used to repeat the same workload a given number of times. 
`iodepth`: Number of I/O units to keep in flight against the file. Note that increasing `iodepth` beyond 1 will not affect synchronous `ioengine`. 
`size`: The total size of file I/O for each thread of this job. 
`direct`: If value is true, use non-buffered I/O. This is usually O_`DIRECT`. 
`blocksize`: The block size in bytes used for I/O units
