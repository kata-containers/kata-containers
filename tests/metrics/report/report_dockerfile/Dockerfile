# Set up an Ubuntu image with the components needed to generate a
# metrics report. That includes:
#  - R
#  - The R 'tidyverse'
#  - pandoc
#  - The report generation R files and helper scripts

# Start with the base rocker tidyverse.
# We would have used the 'verse' base, that already has some of the docs processing
# installed, but I could not figure out how to add in the extra bits we needed to
# the lite tex version is uses.
# Here we specify a tag for base image instead of using latest to let it free from
# the risk from the update of latest base image.
