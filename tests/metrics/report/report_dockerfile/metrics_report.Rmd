# Introduction
This report compares the metrics between multiple sets of data generated from
the [Kata Containers report generation scripts](https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers/tree/main/metrics/report/README.md).

This report was generated using the data from the **`r resultdirs`** results directories.

# Container scaling system footprint
This [test](https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers/blob/main/metrics/density/footprint_data.sh)
measures the system memory footprint impact whilst running an increasing number
of containers. For this test, [KSM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_same-page_merging)
 is enabled. The results show how system memory is consumed for different sized
containers, and their average system memory footprint cost and density (how many
containers you can fit per Gb) is calculated.

```{r footprint-density, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="System Memory density"}
test_name_extra="-ksm"
source('footprint-density.R')
rm(test_name_extra)
