  This file contains a list of all the generic GitHub labels used by all Kata
  Containers GitHub repositories.

  Each repository can optionally contain a top-level `labels.yaml` that
  specifies a list of repository-specific labels (and possibly additional
  categories). The labels in the repository-specific labels file plus the
  labels defined in this file define the minimum list of labels for the
  repository in question.

  Each label must specify:

  - Name (which must be lower-case without spaces)
  - Description
  - Category
  - Colour (explicit colour, or `DEFAULT_COLOUR`)

  A label may also specify a "From" value. This is used for renaming labels;
  if a label has an associated "From" value, an existing label whose name is
  specified by the "From" value will be renamed to the label name.

  A category is a collective name used to describe one or more related labels.
  Each category must specify:

  - Name (which must be lower-case without spaces)
  - Description

  A category may also specify a related URL which points to a document
  containing further information.
