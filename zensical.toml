# Zensical supports both implicit navigation and explicitly defined navigation.
# If you decide not to define a navigation here then Zensical will simply
# derive the navigation structure from the directory structure of your
# "docs_dir". The definition below demonstrates how a navigation structure
# can be defined using TOML syntax.
