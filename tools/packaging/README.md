# Kata Containers packaging

## Introduction

Kata Containers currently supports packages for many distributions. Tooling to
aid in creating these packages are contained within this repository.

## Build in a container

Kata build artifacts are available within a container image, created by a
[Dockerfile](kata-deploy/Dockerfile). Reference DaemonSets are provided in
[`kata-deploy`](kata-deploy), which make installation of Kata Containers in a
running Kubernetes Cluster very straightforward.
