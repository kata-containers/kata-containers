+I/O Address Space ID (IOASID) Controller
+========================================
+
+Acronyms
+--------
+PASID:
+	Process Address Space ID, defined by PCIe
+SVA:
+	Shared Virtual Address
+
+Introduction
+------------
+
+IOASIDs are used to associate DMA requests with virtual address spaces. As
+a system-wide limited¹ resource, its constraints are managed by the IOASIDs
+cgroup subsystem. The specific use cases are:
+
+1. Some user applications exhaust all the available IOASIDs thus depriving
+   others of the same host.
+
+2. System admins need to provision VMs based on their needs for IOASIDs,
+   e.g. the number of VMs with assigned devices that perform DMA requests
+   with PASID.
+
+The IOASID subsystem consists of three components:
+
+- IOASID core: provides APIs for allocation, pool management,
+  notifications and refcounting. See Documentation/driver-api/ioasid.rst
+  for details
+- IOASID user:  provides user allocation interface via /dev/ioasid
+- IOASID cgroup controller: manage resource distribution
+
+Resource Distribution Model
+---------------------------
+IOASID allocation is process-based in that IOASIDs are tied to page tables²,
+the threaded model is not supported. The allocation is rejected by the
+cgroup hierarchy once a limit is reached. However, organizational changes
+such as moving processes across cgroups are exempted. Therefore, it is
+possible to have ioasids.current > ioasids.max. It is not possible to do
+further allocation after the organizational change that exceeds the max.
+
+The system capacity of the IOASIDs is default to PCIe PASID size of 20 bits.
+IOASID core provides API to adjust the system capacity based on platforms.
+IOASIDs are used by both user applications (e.g. VMs and userspace drivers)
+and kernel (e.g. supervisor SVA). However, only user allocation is subject
+to cgroup constraints. Host kernel allocates a pool of IOASIDs where its
+quota is subtracted from the system capacity. IOASIDs cgroup consults with
+the IOASID core for available capacity when a new cgroup limit is granted.
+Upon creation, no IOASID allocation is allowed by the user processes within
+the new cgroup.
+
+Usage
+-----
+CGroup filesystem has the following IOASIDs controller specific entries:
+::
+
+ ioasids.current
+ ioasids.events
+ ioasids.max
+
+To use the IOASIDs controller, set ioasids.max to the limit of the number
+of IOASIDs that can be allocated. The file ioasids.current shows the current
+number of IOASIDs allocated within the cgroup.
+
+Example
+--------
+1. Mount the cgroup2 FS ::
+
+	$ mount -t cgroup2 none /mnt/cg2/
+
+2. Add ioasids controller ::
+
+	$ echo '+ioasids' > /mnt/cg2/cgroup.subtree_control
+
+3. Create a hierarchy, set non-zero limit (default 0) ::
+
+	$ mkdir /mnt/cg2/test1
+	$ echo 5 > /mnt/cg2/test1/ioasids.max
+
+4. Allocate IOASIDs within limit should succeed ::
+
+	$echo $$ > /mnt/cg2/test1/cgroup.procs
+	Do IOASID allocation via /dev/ioasid
+	ioasids.current:1
+	ioasids.max:5
+
+5. Attempt to allocate IOASIDs beyond limit should fail ::
+
+	ioasids.current:5
+	ioasids.max:5
+
+6. Attach a new process with IOASID already allocated to a cgroup could
+result in ioasids.current > ioasids.max, e.g. process with PID 1234 under
+a cgroup with IOASIDs controller has one IOASID allocated, moving it to
+test1 cgroup ::
+
+	$echo 1234 > /mnt/cg2/test1/cgroup.procs
+	ioasids.current:6
+	ioasids.max:5
+
+Notes
+-----
+¹ When IOASID is used for PCI Express PASID, the range is limited to the
+PASID size of 20 bits. For a device that its resources can be shared across
+the platform, the IOASID namespace must be system-wide in order to uniquely
+identify DMA request with PASID inside the device.
+
+² The primary use case is SVA, where CPU page tables are shared with DMA via
+IOMMU.
