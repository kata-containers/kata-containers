Subject: [PATCH 0793/1418] x86/sgx: Support VMA permissions exceeding enclave
 permissions

=== Summary ===

An SGX VMA can only be created if its permissions are the same or
weaker than the Enclave Page Cache Map (EPCM) permissions. After VMA
creation this rule continues to be enforced by the page fault handler.

With SGX2 the EPCM permissions of a page can change after VMA
creation resulting in the VMA exceeding the EPCM permissions and the
page fault handler incorrectly blocking access.

Enable the VMA's pages to remain accessible while ensuring that
the page table entries are installed to match the EPCM permissions
without exceeding the VMA permissions.

=== Full Changelog ===

An SGX enclave is an area of memory where parts of an application
can reside. First an enclave is created and loaded (from
non-enclave memory) with the code and data of an application,
then user space can map (mmap()) the enclave memory to
be able to enter the enclave at its defined entry points for
execution within it.

The hardware maintains a secure structure, the Enclave Page Cache Map
(EPCM), that tracks the contents of the enclave. Of interest here is
its tracking of the enclave page permissions. When a page is loaded
into the enclave its permissions are specified and recorded in the
EPCM. In parallel the OS maintains the page table permissions and
the rule is that page table permissions are never allowed to exceed
EPCM permissions.

A new mapping (mmap()) of enclave memory can only succeed if the
mapping has the same or weaker permissions than the permissions that
were vetted during enclave creation. This is enforced by
sgx_encl_may_map() that is called on the mmap() as well as mprotect()
paths. This permission verification remains.

One feature of SGX2 is to support the modification of enclave page
permissions after enclave creation. Enclave pages may thus already be
mapped at the time their enclave permissions are changed resulting
in the VMA's permissions potentially exceeding the enclave page
permissions.

Enable permissions of existing VMAs to exceed enclave page permissions
in preparation for dynamic enclave page permission changes.
New VMAs that attempt to exceed enclave page permissions continue to be
unsupported.

Reasons why permissions of existing VMAs are allowed to exceed enclave
page permissions instead of dynamically changing VMA permissions when
enclave page permissions change are:
1) Changing VMA permissions involve splitting VMAs which is an operation
   that can fail. Additionally the actual changing of page permissions
   of a range of pages could also fail on any of the pages involved.
   Handling these error cases causes problems. For example, if an
   enclave page permission change fails and the VMA has already been
   split then it is not possible to undo the VMA split nor possible to
   undo the enclave page permission changes that did succeed before the
   failure.
2) The OS has little insight into the user space where EPCM permissions
   are controlled from. For example, a RW page may be made RO just
   before it is made RX and splitting the VMAs while the VMAs may change
   soon is unnecessary.

Remove the extra permission check called on a page fault
(vm_operations_struct->fault) or during debugging
(vm_operations_struct->access) when loading the enclave page from swap
that ensures that the VMA permissions do not exceed the enclave
permissions. Since a VMA could only exist if it passed the original
permission checks during mmap() and a VMA may indeed exceed the page
permissions this extra permission check is no longer appropriate.

With the permission check removed, ensure that page table entries do
not blindly inherit the VMA permissions but instead the permissions
that the VMA and enclave agree on. PTEs for writable pages (from VMA and
enclave perspective) are installed with the writable bit set, reducing
the need for this additional flow to the permission mismatch cases
handled next.
