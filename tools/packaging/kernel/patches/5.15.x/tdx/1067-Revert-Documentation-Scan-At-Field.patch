-Introduction
-------------
-
-Scan At Field (SAF) provides hardware hooks to perform core logic tests
-and report failures for portions of silicon that lack error detection
-capabilities, which will be available in some server SKUs starting with Sapphire
-Rapids. It offers infrastructure to specific users such as cloud providers or
-OEMs to schedule tests and find in-field failures due to aging in silicon that
-might not necessarily be reported with normal machine checks.
-
-SAF uses content provided by Intel that can be regarded as firmware. The image
-is authored and protected by the same integrity mechanisms that protect Intel
-microcode. The image is specific to a processor family, model and stepping.
-SAF image carries the Processor Signature such as family/model/stepping similar
-to what we find in the microcode header. The kernel will load the image that
-matches processor signature. The SAF image is signed by Intel for scan test
-chunk (a.k.a. "test pattern") integrity. The "signed" SAF image contains SHA256
-hashes that will be used for test chunks authentication. The SAF image will be
-distributed via github [1].
-
-Scan test is self-contained. Once the scan test starts, it takes over the CPU
-core completely and does not allow interaction with any other part of the system.
-SAF requires both threads to be isolated when the test is running until the test
-is done, or if configured an external interrupt will break the test in progress
-and its reported to system software. When catastrophic events are signaled,
-currently ongoing test is aborted.
-
-The SAF sysfs provides the interface to run scan tests. The administrator can
-initiate the test either a targeted core or all cores. When the all core test
-is initiated, the kernel will step through one core at a time from core 0 executing
-the test content from chunk 0 to the last chunk, then moves to the next core.
-Once all cores have been tested once, the test is stopped waiting for another
-command to start scan. For "targeted core" testing, the administrator can target
-a specific core and run scan on it. The kernel will only test the target core
-starting from start_chunk to stop_chunk as specified in the sysfs.
-
-SAF Image
----------
-
-The SAF image has an external header for software to select the right image,
-hashes that hardware uses to authenticate the test chunk is correct, and the
-test content itself. SAF image carries the Processor Signature such as
-family/model/stepping similar to what we find in the microcode header. The kernel
-will load the image that matches processor signature.
-
-The SAF image file follows a similar naming convention to Intel CPU microcode
-files. The file must be located in the firmware directory where the microcode
-files are placed and named as {family/model/stepping}.scan as below:
-
-/lib/firmware/intel/ift/saf/{ff-mm-ss}.scan
-
-SAF Image Loading
------------------
-
-Before a core can be scanned, the SAF image needs to be staged to protected
-memory. The required sequences are 1) load the scan hashes; 2) load the test
-chunks. The CPU will check if the test chunks match the hashes, otherwise
-failure is indicated to system software. If all chunks have been authenticated
-successfully, the chunks will be copied to secured memory. The scan hash copy
-and authentication need only be done at the first logical cpu on each socket.
-
-The administrator can reload the SAF image at runtime. For example, when the new
-SAF image is released, the administrator can overwrite the old image with the same
-filename. The reload can be done via sysfs. echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/scan/reload
-
-Triggering scan
----------------
-
-The SAF module creates scan worker kthreads for all online logical cpus when
-installed. The administrator can trigger scan test via sysfs. Once scan test is
-triggered on a specific logical cpu, it wakes up the corresponding worker thread
-and its sibling threads to execute the test. Once the scan test is done, the
-threads go back to thread wait for next signal to start a new scan.
-
-Before a scan test begins, data is flushed from the L1/L2 caches on the core. While
-a scan test is in the process, the core is isolated from the L3 and memory subsystems.
-In other words, scan test is confined to core perimeter and will have no effect
-outside of core.
-
-In a core, the scan engine is shared between siblings. When the scan test is
-triggered on a core, all the siblings join the core before the scan execution.
-The scan result is a core scoped MSR, which the system software reflects that via
-/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu#/scan/scan_result.
-
-The SAF module offers two main test modes. First of all, it provides the interface
-to test all cores automatically via sysfs. When all core testing is triggered, the kernel
-will start testing from the first online core and proceed to test each core one
-after another. In the all core test, each core is tested from chunk 0 to the last
-chunk enumerated. /sys/devices/system/cpu/scan/num_chunks
-The "all core test" can be triggered via sysfs as below.
-
-echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/scan/run_test_all
-
-On the other hand, the administrator can only target a specific core with specific
-chunks. In this mode, the administrator needs to specify the chunk range before
-the scan. The basic flow is as follows.
-
-1. Set the chunk range in a target core.
-   echo "<start_chunk>" > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu#/scan/start_chunk
-   echo "<stop_chunk>" > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu#/scan/stop_chunk
-
-2. The scan for a core is started by writing the scan_start file for any of the threads in
-   the core.
-   echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu#/scan/scan_start
-
-There is a limit on how many cores can execute a targeted test simultaneously. This is
-available in /sys/devices/system/cpu/max_parallel_tests.
-
-Activating scan itself is protected against multiple scan starts. The SAF module does
-not allow another scan initiation in the same core until the current scan test is finished.
-Once scan is done, the administrator can check the result via sysfs. Whether scan was
-run via all core test or target core test, the scan result is stored per logical cpu.
-/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu#/scan/scan_result
-
-Scan may be aborted by some reasons. Scan test will be aborted with certain circumstances
-such as when interrupt occurred or cpu does not have enough power budget for SAF. In this
-case, the kernel restart scan from the chunk where it stopped. Scan will also be aborted
-when the test is failed. In this case, the test is immediately stopped without retry.
-
-Tunable Parameters
-------------------
-
-This module accepts four tunable parameters. These could be provided at
-load time or can be modified at runtime through sysfs.
-(/sys/devices/system/cpu/scan/<parameter_name>). The parameters are as
-described below.
-
-1. core_delay: How many milliseconds must the kernel wait after a test is done before
-	       triggering another core test.
-2. noint: When set, system interrupts are not allowed to interrupt a scan.
-3. trigger_mce: It tells SAF to trigger a MCE when the test fails.
-4. thread_wait: The maximum time to allow microcode to wait for a core
-		and its sibling joining for synchronization.
