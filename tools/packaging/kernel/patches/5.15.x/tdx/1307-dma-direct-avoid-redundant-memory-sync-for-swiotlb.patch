Subject: [PATCH 1307/1418] dma-direct: avoid redundant memory sync for swiotlb

commit 9e02977bfad006af328add9434c8bffa40e053bb upstream.

When we looked into FIO performance with swiotlb enabled in VM, we found
swiotlb_bounce() is always called one more time than expected for each DMA
read request.

It turns out that the bounce buffer is copied to original DMA buffer twice
after the completion of a DMA request (one is done by in
dma_direct_sync_single_for_cpu(), the other by swiotlb_tbl_unmap_single()).
But the content in bounce buffer actually doesn't change between the two
rounds of copy. So, one round of copy is redundant.

Pass DMA_ATTR_SKIP_CPU_SYNC flag to swiotlb_tbl_unmap_single() to
skip the memory copy in it.

This fix increases FIO 64KB sequential read throughput in a guest with
swiotlb=force by 5.6%.

Fixes: 55897af63091 ("dma-direct: merge swiotlb_dma_ops into the dma_direct code")
