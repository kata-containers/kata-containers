# PTP clock support
#
# The implementation of ptp_kvm on arm is one experimental feature,
# you need to apply private patches to enable it on your host machine.
# See https://github.com/kata-containers/packaging/pull/998 for detailed info.
#
# as ptp_kvm is under review in upstream and linux kernel in virtio-fs branch
# will change with time, we need update the patch again and again. For now, we
# disable ptp_kvm to wait for the stable kernel version of virtio-fs or ptp_kvm
# accept by upstream.
