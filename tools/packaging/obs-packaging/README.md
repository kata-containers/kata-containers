# Building under OBS

SUSE's [Open Build Service (OBS)](https://openbuildservice.org) is used to
build [the official Kata Containers packages](https://build.opensuse.org/project/subprojects/home:katacontainers).

This directory contains tooling and packaging metadata to build all Kata
components with OBS.

See
[the Kata installation documentation](../../../docs/install/README.md)
for instructions on how to install the official packages.
