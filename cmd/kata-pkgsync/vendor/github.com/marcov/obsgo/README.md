### obsgo

Package obsgo implements some of the [Open Build Service APIs](https://build.opensuse.org/apidocs/index)
for interacting with an OBS project from a Go application.

At the moment uniquely a limited subset of APIs are implemented, focusing on
those needed to retrieve information about packages, and downloading build
artifacts.
