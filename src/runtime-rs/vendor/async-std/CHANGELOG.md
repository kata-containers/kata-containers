# Changelog

All notable changes to async-std will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://book.async.rs/overview/stability-guarantees.html).

# [1.12.0] - 2022-06-18

## Added
- `std::task_spawn_blocking` is now stabilized. We consider it a fundamental API for bridging between blocking code and async code, and we widely use it within async-std's own implementation.
- Add `TryFrom` implementations to convert `TcpListener`, `TcpStream`, `UdpSocket`, `UnixDatagram`, `UnixListener`, and `UnixStream` to their synchronous equivalents, including putting them back into blocking mode.

## Changed
- async-std no longer depends on `num_cpus`; it uses functionality in the standard library instead (via `async-global-executor`).
- Miscellaneous documentation fixes and cleanups.

# [1.11.0] - 2022-03-22

This release improves compile times by up to 55% on initial builds, and up to 75% on recompilation. Additionally we've added a few new APIs and made some tweaks.

## Added
- `TcpListener::into_incoming` to convert a `TcpListener` into a stream of incoming TCP connections

## Removed
- The internal `extension_trait` macro had been removed. This drastically improves compile times for `async-std`, but changes the way our documentation is rendered. This is a cosmetic change only, and all existing code should continue to work as it did before.

## Changed
- Some internal code has been de-macro-ified, making for quicker compile times.
- We now use the default recursion limit.

## Docs
- Several docs improvements / fixes.

# [1.10.0] - 2021-08-25

This release comes with an assortment of small features and fixes.

## Added
- `File` now implements `Clone` so that `File`s can be passed into closures for use in `spawn_blocking`.
    - `File`'s contents are already wrapped in `Arc`s, so the implementation of `Clone` is straightforward.
- `task::try_current()` which returns a handle to the current task if called within the context of a task created by async-std.
- `async_std::io` now re-exports `WriteExt` directly.

## Fixed
- `write!` now takes already written bytes into account on `File`.

## Internal
- `TcpStream` now properly makes use of vectored IO.
- The `net::*::Incoming` implementations now do less allocation.

## Docs
- Several docs improvements / fixes.

# [1.9.0] - 2021-01-15

This patch stabilizes the `async_std::channel` submodule, removes the
deprecated `sync::channel` types, and introduces the `tokio1` feature.

## New Channels

As part of our `1.8.0` release last month we introduced the new
`async_std::channel` submodule and deprecated the unstable
`async_std::sync::channel` types. You can read our full motiviation for this
change in the last patch notes. But the short version is that the old
channels had some fundamental problems, and the `sync` submodule is a bit of
a mess.

This release of `async-std` promotes `async_std::channel` to stable, and
fully removes the `async_std::sync::channel` types. In practice many
libraries have already been upgraded to the new channels in the past month,
and this will enable much of the ecosystem to switch off "unstable" versions
of `async-std`.

```rust
use async_std::channel;

let (sender, receiver) = channel::unbounded();

assert_eq!(sender.send("Hello").await, Ok(()));
assert_eq!(receiver.recv().await, Ok("Hello"));
```

## Tokio 1.0 compat

The Tokio project recently released version 1.0 of their runtime, and the
async-std team would like to congratulate the Tokio team on achieving this
milestone.

This release of `async-std` adds the `tokio1` feature flag, enabling Tokio's
TLS constructors to be initialized within the `async-std` runtime. This is in
addition to the `tokio02` and `tokio03` feature flags which we were already
exposing.

In terms of stability it's worth noting that we will continue to provide
support for the `tokio02`, `tokio03`, and `tokio1` on the current major
release line of `async-std`. These flags are part of our public API, and
removing compat support for older Tokio versions is considered a breaking
change.

## Added

- Added the `tokio1` feature ([#924](https://github.com/async-rs/async-std/pull/924))
- Stabilized the `async_std::channel` submodule ([#934](https://github.com/async-rs/async-std/pull/934))

## Removed

- Removed deprecated `sync::channel` ([#933](https://github.com/async-rs/async-std/pull/933))

## Fixed

- Fixed a typo for [sic] `FuturesExt` trait ([#930](https://github.com/async-rs/async-std/pull/930))
- Update the link to `cargo-edit` in the installation section of the docs ([#932](https://github.com/async-rs/async-std/pull/932))
- Fixed a small typo for stream ([#926](https://github.com/async-rs/async-std/pull/926))

## Internal

- Updated `rand` to 0.8 ([#923](https://github.com/async-rs/async-std/pull/923))
- Migrated `RwLock` and `Barrier` to use the `async-lock` crate internally ([#925](https://github.com/async-rs/async-std/pull/925))
- Replaced uses of deprecated the `compare_and_swap` method with `compare_exchange` ([#927](https://github.com/async-rs/async-std/pull/927))

# [1.8.0] - 2020-12-04

This patch introduces `async_std::channel`, a new submodule for our async channels implementation. `channels` have been one of async-std's most requested features, and have existed as "unstable" for the past year. We've been cautious about stabilizing channels, and this caution turned out to be warranted: we realized our channels could hang indefinitely under certain circumstances, and people ended up expressing a need for unbounded channels.

So today we're introducing the new `async_std::channel` submodule which exports the `async-channel` crate, and we're marking the older unstable `async_std::sync::channel` API as "deprecated". This release includes both APIs, but we intend to stabilize `async_std::channel` and remove the older API in January. This should give dependent projects a month to upgrade, though we can extend that if it proves to be too short.

The rationale for adding a new top-level `channel` submodule, rather than extending `sync` is that the `std::sync` and `async_std::sync` submodule are a bit of a mess, and the libs team [has been talking about splitting `std::sync` up]([https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2788#discussion_r339092478](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2788#discussion_r339092478)) into separate modules. The stdlib has to guarantee it'll forever be backwards compatible, but `async-std` does not (we fully expect a 2.0 once we have async closures & traits). So we're experimenting with this change before `std` does, with the expectation that this change can serve as a data point when the libs team decides how to proceed in std.

# [1.4.0] - 2019-12-20

[API Documentation](https://docs.rs/async-std/1.4.0/async-std)

This patch adds `Future::timeout`, providing a method counterpart to the
`future::timeout` free function. And includes several bug fixes around missing
APIs. Notably we're not shipping our new executor yet, first announced [on our
blog](https://async.rs/blog/stop-worrying-about-blocking-the-new-async-std-runtime/).

## Examples

```rust
use async_std::prelude::*;
use async_std::future;
use std::time::Duration;

let fut = future::pending::<()>(); // This future will never resolve.
let res = fut.timeout(Duration::from_millis(100)).await;
assert!(res.is_err()); // The future timed out, returning an err.
```

## Added

- Added `Future::timeout` as "unstable" [(#600)](https://github.com/async-rs/async-std/pull/600)

## Fixes

- Fixed a doc test and enabled it on CI [(#597)](https://github.com/async-rs/async-std/pull/597)
- Fixed a rendering issue with the `stream` submodule documentation [(#621)](https://github.com/async-rs/async-std/pull/621)

- Fixed the missing `io::Take` export [(#633)](https://github.com/async-rs/async-std/pull/633)

# [1.3.0] - 2019-12-12

[API Documentation](https://docs.rs/async-std/1.3.0/async-std)

This patch introduces `Stream::delay`, more methods on `DoubleEndedStream`,
and improves compile times. `Stream::delay` is a new API that's similar to
[`task::sleep`](https://docs.rs/async-std/1.2.0/async_std/task/fn.sleep.html),
but can be passed as part of as stream, rather than as a separate block. This is
useful for examples, or when manually debugging race conditions.

## Examples

```rust
let start = Instant::now();
let mut s = stream::from_iter(vec![0u8, 1]).delay(Duration::from_millis(200));

// The first time will take more than 200ms due to delay.
s.next().await;
assert!(start.elapsed().as_millis() >= 200);

// There will be no delay after the first time.
s.next().await;
assert!(start.elapsed().as_millis() <= 210);
```

## Added

- Added `Stream::delay` as "unstable" [(#309)](https://github.com/async-rs/async-std/pull/309)
- Added `DoubleEndedStream::next_back` as "unstable" [(#562)](https://github.com/async-rs/async-std/pull/562)
- Added `DoubleEndedStream::nth_back` as "unstable" [(#562)](https://github.com/async-rs/async-std/pull/562)
- Added `DoubleEndedStream::rfind` as "unstable" [(#562)](https://github.com/async-rs/async-std/pull/562)
- Added `DoubleEndedStream::rfold` as "unstable" [(#562)](https://github.com/async-rs/async-std/pull/562)
- Added `DoubleEndedStream::try_rfold` as "unstable" [(#562)](https://github.com/async-rs/async-std/pull/562)
- `stream::Once` now implements `DoubleEndedStream` [(#562)](https://github.com/async-rs/async-std/pull/562)
- `stream::FromIter` now implements `DoubleEndedStream` [(#562)](https://github.com/async-rs/async-std/pull/562)

## Changed

- Removed our dependency on `async-macros`, speeding up compilation [(#610)](https://github.com/async-rs/async-std/pull/610)

## Fixes

- Fixed a link in the task docs [(#598)](https://github.com/async-rs/async-std/pull/598)
- Fixed the `UdpSocket::recv` example [(#603)](https://github.com/async-rs/async-std/pull/603)
- Fixed a link to `task::block_on` [(#608)](https://github.com/async-rs/async-std/pull/608)
- Fixed an incorrect API mention in `task::Builder` [(#612)](https://github.com/async-rs/async-std/pull/612)
- Fixed leftover mentions of `futures-preview` [(#595)](https://github.com/async-rs/async-std/pull/595)
- Fixed a typo in the tutorial [(#614)](https://github.com/async-rs/async-std/pull/614)
- `<TcpStream as Write>::poll_close` now closes the write half of the stream [(#618)](https://github.com/async-rs/async-std/pull/618)

# [1.2.0] - 2019-11-27

[API Documentation](https://docs.rs/async-std/1.2.0/async-std)

This patch includes some minor quality-of-life improvements, introduces a
new `Stream::unzip` API, and adds verbose errors to our networking types.

This means if you can't connect to a socket, you'll never have to wonder again
*which* address it was you couldn't connect to, instead of having to go through
the motions to debug what the address was.

## Example

Unzip a stream of tuples into two collections:

```rust
use async_std::prelude::*;
use async_std::stream;

let s = stream::from_iter(vec![(1,2), (3,4)]);

let (left, right): (Vec<_>, Vec<_>) = s.unzip().await;

assert_eq!(left, [1, 3]);
assert_eq!(right, [2, 4]);
```

## Added

- Added `Stream::unzip` as "unstable".
- Added verbose errors to the networking types.

## Changed

- Enabled CI.
- `Future::join` and `Future::try_join` can now join futures with different
  output types.

## Fixed

- Fixed the docs and `Debug` output of `BufWriter`.
- Fixed a bug in `Stream::throttle` that made it consume too much CPU.

# [1.1.0] - 2019-11-21

[API Documentation](https://docs.rs/async-std/1.1.0/async-std)

This patch introduces a faster scheduler algorithm, `Stream::throttle`, and
stabilizes `task::yield_now`. Additionally we're introducing several more stream
APIs, bringing us to almost complete parity with the standard library.

Furthermore our `path` submodule now returns more context in errors. So if
opening a file fails, async-std will tell you *which* file was failed to open,
making it easier to write and debug programs.

## Examples

```rust
let start = Instant::now();

let mut s = stream::interval(Duration::from_millis(5))
    .throttle(Duration::from_millis(10))
    .take(2);

s.next().await;
assert!(start.elapsed().as_millis() >= 5);

s.next().await;
assert!(start.elapsed().as_millis() >= 15);

s.next().await;
assert!(start.elapsed().as_millis() >= 25);
```

## Added

- Added `Stream::throttle` as "unstable".
- Added `Stream::count` as "unstable".
- Added `Stream::max` as "unstable".
- Added `Stream::successors` as "unstable".
- Added `Stream::by_ref` as "unstable".
- Added `Stream::partition` as "unstable".
- Added contextual errors to the `path` submodule.
- Added `os::windows::symlink_dir` as "unstable".
- Added `os::windows::symlink_file` as "unstable".
- Stabilized `task::yield_now`.

## Fixes

- We now ignore seek errors when rolling back failed `read` calls on `File`.
- Fixed a bug where `Stream::max_by_key` was returning the wrong result.
- Fixed a bug where `Stream::min_by_key` was returning the wrong result.

## Changed

- Applied various fixes to the tutorial.
- Fixed an issue with Clippy.
- Optimized an internal code generation macro, improving compilation speeds.
- Removed an `Unpin` bound from `stream::Once`.
- Removed various extra internal uses of `pin_mut!`.
- Simplified `Stream::any` and `Stream::all`'s internals.
- The `surf` example is now enabled again.
- Tweaked some streams internals.
- Updated `futures-timer` to 2.0.0, improving compilation speed.
- Upgraded `async-macros` to 2.0.0.
- `Stream::merge` now uses randomized ordering to reduce overall latency.
- The scheduler is now more efficient by keeping a slot for the next task to
  run. This is similar to Go's scheduler, and Tokio's scheduler.
- Fixed the documentation of the `channel` types to link back to the `channel`
  function.

# [1.0.1] - 2019-11-12

[API Documentation](https://docs.rs/async-std/1.0.1/async-std)

We were seeing a regression in our fs performance, caused by too many
long-running tasks. This patch fixes that regression by being more proactive
about closing down idle threads.

## Changes

- Improved thread startup/shutdown algorithm in `task::spawn_blocking`.
- Fixed a typo in the tutorial.

# [1.0.0] - 2019-11-11

[API Documentation](https://docs.rs/async-std/1.0.0/async-std)

This release marks the `1.0.0` release of async-std; a major milestone for our
development. This release itself mostly includes quality of life improvements
for all of modules, including more consistent API bounds for a lot of our
submodules.

The biggest change is that we're now using the full semver range,
`major.minor.patch`, and any breaking changes to our "stable" APIs will require
an update of the `major` number.

We're excited we've hit this milestone together with you all. Thank you!

## Added

- Added `Future::join` as "unstable", replacing `future::join!`.
- Added `Future::try_join` as "unstable", replacing `future::try_join!`.
- Enabled `stable` and `beta` channel testing on CI.
- Implemented `FromIterator` and `Extend` for `PathBuf`.
- Implemented `FromStream` for `PathBuf`.
- Loosened the trait bounds of `io::copy` on "unstable".

## Changed

- Added a `Sync` bound to `RwLock`, resolving a memory safety issue.
- Fixed a bug in `Stream::take_while` where it could continue after it should've
  ended.
- Fixed a bug where our `attributes` Cargo feature wasn't working as intended.
- Improved documentation of `Stream::merge`, documenting  ordering guarantees.
- Update doc imports in examples to prefer async-std's types.
- Various quality of life improvements to the `future` submodule.
- Various quality of life improvements to the `path` submodule.
- Various quality of life improvements to the `stream` submodule.

## Removed

# [0.99.11] - 2019-10-29

This patch introduces `async_std::sync::channel`, a novel asynchronous port of
the ultra-fast Crossbeam channels. This has been one of the most anticipated
features for async-std, and we're excited to be providing a first version of
this!

In addition to channels, this patch has the regular list of new methods, types,
and doc fixes.

## Examples

__Send and receive items from a channel__
```rust
// Create a bounded channel with a max-size of 1
let (s, r) = channel(1);

// This call returns immediately because there is enough space in the channel.
s.send(1).await;

task::spawn(async move {
    // This call blocks the current task because the channel is full.
    // It will be able to complete only after the first message is received.
    s.send(2).await;
});

// Receive items from the channel
task::sleep(Duration::from_secs(1)).await;
assert_eq!(r.recv().await, Some(1));
assert_eq!(r.recv().await, Some(2));
```

## Added
- Added `Future::delay` as "unstable"
- Added `Stream::flat_map` as "unstable"
- Added `Stream::flatten` as "unstable"
- Added `Stream::product` as "unstable"
- Added `Stream::sum` as "unstable"
- Added `Stream::min_by_key`
- Added `Stream::max_by`
- Added `Stream::timeout` as "unstable"
- Added `sync::channel` as "unstable".
- Added doc links from instantiated structs to the methods that create them.
- Implemented `Extend` + `FromStream` for `PathBuf`.

## Changed
- Fixed an issue with `block_on` so it works even when nested.
- Fixed issues with our Clippy check on CI.
- Replaced our uses of `cfg_if` with our own macros, simplifying the codebase.
- Updated the homepage link in `Cargo.toml` to point to [async.rs](https://async.rs).
- Updated the module-level documentation for `stream` and `sync`.
- Various typos and grammar fixes.
- Removed redundant file flushes, improving the performance of `File` operations

## Removed
Nothing was removed in this release.

# [0.99.10] - 2019-10-16

This patch stabilizes several core concurrency macros, introduces async versions
of `Path` and `PathBuf`, and adds almost 100 other commits.

## Examples

__Asynchronously read directories from the filesystem__
```rust
use async_std::fs;
use async_std::path::Path;
use async_std::prelude::*;

let path = Path::new("/laputa");
let mut dir = fs::read_dir(&path).await.unwrap();
while let Some(entry) = dir.next().await {
    if let Ok(entry) = entry {
        println!("{:?}", entry.path());
    }
}
```

__Cooperatively reschedule the current task on the executor__
```rust
use async_std::prelude::*;
use async_std::task;

task::spawn(async {
    let x = fibonnacci(1000); // Do expensive work
    task::yield_now().await;  // Allow other tasks to run
    x + fibonnacci(100)       // Do more work
})
```

__Create an interval stream__
```rust
use async_std::prelude::*;
use async_std::stream;
use std::time::Duration;

let mut interval = stream::interval(Duration::from_secs(4));
while let Some(_) = interval.next().await {
    println!("prints every four seconds");

# [0.99.9] - 2019-10-08

This patch upgrades our `futures-rs` version, allowing us to build on the 1.39
beta. Additionally we've introduced `map` and `for_each` to `Stream`. And we've
added about a dozen new `FromStream` implementations for `std` types, bringing
us up to par with std's `FromIterator` implementations.

And finally we've added a new "unstable" `task::blocking` function which can be
used to convert blocking code into async code using a threadpool. We've been
using this internally for a while now to async-std to power our `fs` and
`net::SocketAddr` implementations. With this patch userland code now finally has
access to this too.

## Example

__Create a stream of tuples, and collect into a hashmap__
```rust
let a = stream::once(1u8);
let b = stream::once(0u8);

let s = a.zip(b);

let map: HashMap<u8, u8> = s.collect().await;
assert_eq!(map.get(&1), Some(&0u8));
```

__Spawn a blocking task on a dedicated threadpool__
```rust
task::blocking(async {
    println!("long-running task here");
}).await;
```

## Added

- Added `stream::Stream::map`
- Added `stream::Stream::for_each`
- Added `stream::Stream::try_for_each`
- Added `task::blocking` as "unstable"
- Added `FromStream` for all `std::{option, collections, result, string, sync}` types.
- Added the `path` submodule as "unstable".

## Changed

- Updated `futures-preview` to `0.3.0-alpha.19`, allowing us to build on `rustc 1.39.0-beta`.
- As a consequence of this upgrade, all of our concrete stream implementations
  now make use of `Stream::size_hint` to optimize internal allocations.
- We now use GitHub Actions through [actions-rs](https://github.com/actions-rs),
  in addition to Travis CI. We intend to fully switch in the near future.
- Fixed a bug introduced in 0.99.6 where Unix Domain Listeners would sometimes become unresponsive.
- Updated our `sync::Barrier` docs to match std.
- Updated our `stream::FromStream` docs to match std's `FromIterator`.
