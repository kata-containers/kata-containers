//! Traits and Structs to manage interrupt sources for devices.
//!
//! Software indicating an event that needs immediate attention. An interrupt alerts the processor
//! to a high-priority condition requiring the interruption of the current code the processor is
//! executing. The processor responds by suspending its current activities, saving its state, and
//! executing a function called an interrupt handler (or an interrupt service routine, ISR) to deal
//! with the event. This interruption is temporary, and, after the interrupt handler finishes,
//! unless handling the interrupt has emitted a fatal error, the processor resumes normal
//! activities.
//!
//! Hardware interrupts are used by devices to communicate that they require attention from the
//! operating system, or a bare-metal program running on the CPU if there are no OSes. The act of
//! initiating a hardware interrupt is referred to as an interrupt request (IRQ). Different devices
//! are usually associated with different interrupts using a unique value associated with each
//! interrupt. This makes it possible to know which hardware device caused which interrupts. These
//! interrupt values are often called IRQ lines, or just interrupt lines.
//!
//! Nowadays, IRQ lines is not the only mechanism to deliver device interrupts to processors. MSI
//! [(Message Signaled Interrupt)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Signaled_Interrupts) is
//! another commonly used alternative in-band method of signaling an interrupt, using special
//! in-band messages to replace traditional out-of-band assertion of dedicated interrupt lines.
//! While more complex to implement in a device, message signaled interrupts have some significant
//! advantages over pin-based out-of-band interrupt signaling. Message signaled interrupts are
//! supported in PCI bus since its version 2.2, and in later available PCI Express bus. Some non-PCI
//! architectures also use message signaled interrupts.
//!
//! While IRQ is a term commonly used by Operating Systems when dealing with hardware interrupts,
//! the IRQ numbers managed by OSes are independent of the ones managed by VMM. For simplicity sake,
//! the term `Interrupt Source` is used instead of IRQ to represent both pin-based interrupts and
//! MSI interrupts.
//!
//! A device may support multiple types of interrupts, and each type of interrupt may support one or
//! multiple interrupt sources. For example, a PCI device may support:
//! * Legacy Irq: exactly one interrupt source.
//! * PCI MSI Irq: 1,2,4,8,16,32 interrupt sources.
//! * PCI MSIx Irq: 2^n(n=0-11) interrupt sources.
//!
//! A distinct Interrupt Source Identifier (ISID) will be assigned to each interrupt source. An ID
//! allocator will be used to allocate and free Interrupt Source Identifiers for devices. To
//! decouple this crate from the ID allocator, here we doesn't take the responsibility to
//! allocate/free Interrupt Source IDs but only makes use of assigned IDs.
//!
//! The overall flow to deal with interrupts is:
//! * the VMM creates an interrupt manager
//! * the VMM creates a device manager, passing on an reference to the interrupt manager
//! * the device manager passes on an reference to the interrupt manager to all registered devices
//! * guest kernel loads drivers for virtual devices
//! * guest device driver determines the type and number of interrupts needed, and update the device
//!   configuration
//! * the virtual device backend requests the interrupt manager to create an interrupt group
//!   according to guest configuration information
