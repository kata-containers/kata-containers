#![no_std]
//! Streams that produce elements with an associated ordering.
//!
//! Say you have a bunch of events that all have a timestamp, sequence number, or other ordering
//! attribute.  If you get these events from multiple [`Stream`](core::stream::Stream)s, then you
//! should be able to produce a "composite" stream by joining each of the individual streams, so
//! long as each originating stream is ordered.
//!
//! However, if you actually implement this, you discover that you need to buffer at least one
//! element from each stream in order to avoid ordering inversions if the sources are independent
//! (including just running in different tasks).  This presents a problem if one of the sources
//! rarely produces events: that slow source can stall all other streams in order to handle the
//! case where the slowness is due to an earlier element instead of just having no elements.
//!
//! The [`OrderedStream`] trait provides a way to solve this problem: if you can ask a stream if it
//! will ever have any events that should be delivered before a given event, then you can often
//! avoid blocking the composite stream when data is ready.
