//! Making [`Arc`][Arc] itself atomic
//!
//! The [`ArcSwap`] type is a container for an `Arc` that can be changed atomically. Semantically,
//! it is similar to something like `Atomic<Arc<T>>` (if there was such a thing) or
//! `RwLock<Arc<T>>` (but without the need for the locking). It is optimized for read-mostly
//! scenarios, with consistent performance characteristics.
//!
//! # Motivation
//!
//! There are many situations in which one might want to have some data structure that is often
//! read and seldom updated. Some examples might be a configuration of a service, routing tables,
//! snapshot of some data that is renewed every few minutes, etc.
//!
//! In all these cases one needs:
//! * Being able to read the current value of the data structure, fast, often and concurrently from
//!   many threads.
//! * Using the same version of the data structure over longer period of time ‒ a query should be
//!   answered by a consistent version of data, a packet should be routed either by an old or by a
//!   new version of the routing table but not by a combination, etc.
//! * Perform an update without disrupting the processing.
//!
//! The first idea would be to use [`RwLock<T>`][RwLock] and keep a read-lock for the whole time of
//! processing. Update would, however, pause all processing until done.
//!
//! Better option would be to have [`RwLock<Arc<T>>`][RwLock]. Then one would lock, clone the [Arc]
//! and unlock. This suffers from CPU-level contention (on the lock and on the reference count of
//! the [Arc]) which makes it relatively slow. Depending on the implementation, an update may be
//! blocked for arbitrary long time by a steady inflow of readers.
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use std::sync::{Arc, RwLock};
//! # use once_cell::sync::Lazy;
//! # struct RoutingTable; struct Packet; impl RoutingTable { fn route(&self, _: Packet) {} }
//! static ROUTING_TABLE: Lazy<RwLock<Arc<RoutingTable>>> = Lazy::new(|| {
//!     RwLock::new(Arc::new(RoutingTable))
//! });
//!
//! fn process_packet(packet: Packet) {
//!     let table = Arc::clone(&ROUTING_TABLE.read().unwrap());
//!     table.route(packet);
//! }
//! # fn main() { process_packet(Packet); }
//! ```
//!
//! The [ArcSwap] can be used instead, which solves the above problems and has better performance
//! characteristics than the [RwLock], both in contended and non-contended scenarios.
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use arc_swap::ArcSwap;
//! # use once_cell::sync::Lazy;
//! # struct RoutingTable; struct Packet; impl RoutingTable { fn route(&self, _: Packet) {} }
//! static ROUTING_TABLE: Lazy<ArcSwap<RoutingTable>> = Lazy::new(|| {
//!     ArcSwap::from_pointee(RoutingTable)
//! });
//!
//! fn process_packet(packet: Packet) {
//!     let table = ROUTING_TABLE.load();
//!     table.route(packet);
//! }
//! # fn main() { process_packet(Packet); }
//! ```
//!
//! # Crate contents
//!
//! At the heart of the crate there are [`ArcSwap`] and [`ArcSwapOption`] types, containers for an
//! [`Arc`] and [`Option<Arc>`][Option].
//!
//! Technically, these are type aliases for partial instantiations of the [`ArcSwapAny`] type. The
//! [`ArcSwapAny`] is more flexible and allows tweaking of many things (can store other things than
//! [`Arc`]s, can configure the locking [`Strategy`]). For details about the tweaking, see the
//! documentation of the [`strategy`] module and the [`RefCnt`] trait.
//!
//! The [`cache`] module provides means for speeding up read access of the contained data at the
//! cost of delayed reclamation.
//!
//! The [`access`] module can be used to do projections into the contained data to separate parts
//! of application from each other (eg. giving a component access to only its own part of
//! configuration while still having it reloaded as a whole).
//!
//! # Before using
//!
//! The data structure is a bit niche. Before using, please check the
//! [limitations and common pitfalls][docs::limitations] and the [performance
//! characteristics][docs::performance], including choosing the right [read
//! operation][docs::performance#read-operations].
//!
//! You can also get an inspiration about what's possible in the [common patterns][docs::patterns]
//! section.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```rust
//! use std::sync::Arc;
//!
//! use arc_swap::ArcSwap;
//! use crossbeam_utils::thread;
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     let config = ArcSwap::from(Arc::new(String::default()));
//!     thread::scope(|scope| {
//!         scope.spawn(|_| {
//!             let new_conf = Arc::new("New configuration".to_owned());
//!             config.store(new_conf);
//!         });
//!         for _ in 0..10 {
//!             scope.spawn(|_| {
//!                 loop {
//!                     let cfg = config.load();
//!                     if !cfg.is_empty() {
//!                         assert_eq!(**cfg, "New configuration");
//!                         return;
//!                     }
//!                 }
//!             });
//!         }
//!     }).unwrap();
//! }

    ///
    /// Sometimes, an application consists of components. Each component has its own configuration
    /// structure. The whole configuration contains all the smaller config parts.
    ///
    /// For the sake of separation and abstraction, it is not desirable to pass the whole
    /// configuration to each of the components. This allows the component to take only access to
    /// its own part.
    ///
    /// # Lifetimes & flexibility
    ///
    /// This method is not the most flexible way, as the returned type borrows into the `ArcSwap`.
    /// To provide access into eg. `Arc<ArcSwap<T>>`, you can create the [`Map`] type directly. See
    /// the [`access`] module.

    /// # Performance
    ///
