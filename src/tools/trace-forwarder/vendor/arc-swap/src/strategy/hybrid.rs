//! A hybrid strategy.
//!
//! This is based on debts ‒ an Arc may owe a reference, but it is marked in the debt. It is either
//! put back (by stopping using it), or if the pointer is replaced, the writer bumps the reference
//! count and removes the debt.
//!
//! The strategy uses two different slots for the debts. The first ones are faster, but fallible.
//! If they fail (either because there's interference from a writer at the same time, or because
//! they are full), the secondary one that is slower, but always succeeds, is used. In the latter
//! case, the reference is bumped and this secondary debt slot is released, so it is available for
//! further loads.
//!
//! See the [crate::debt] module for the actual slot manipulation. Here we just wrap them into the
//! strategy.
