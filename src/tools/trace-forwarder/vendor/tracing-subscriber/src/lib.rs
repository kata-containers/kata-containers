//! Utilities for implementing and composing [`tracing`] subscribers.
//!
//! [`tracing`] is a framework for instrumenting Rust programs to collect
//! scoped, structured, and async-aware diagnostics. The [`Subscriber`] trait
//! represents the functionality necessary to collect this trace data. This
//! crate contains tools for composing subscribers out of smaller units of
//! behaviour, and batteries-included implementations of common subscriber
//! functionality.
//!
//! `tracing-subscriber` is intended for use by both `Subscriber` authors and
//! application authors using `tracing` to instrument their applications.
//!
//! *Compiler support: [requires `rustc` 1.42+][msrv]*
//!
//! [msrv]: #supported-rust-versions
//!
//! ## `Layer`s and `Filter`s
//!
//! The most important component of the `tracing-subscriber` API is the
//! [`Layer`] trait, which provides a composable abstraction for building
//! [`Subscriber`]s. Like the [`Subscriber`] trait, a [`Layer`] defines a
//! particular behavior for collecting trace data. Unlike [`Subscriber`]s,
//! which implement a *complete* strategy for how trace data is collected,
//! [`Layer`]s provide *modular* implementations of specific behaviors.
//! Therefore, they can be [composed together] to form a [`Subscriber`] which is
//! capable of recording traces in a variety of ways. See the [`layer` module's
//! documentation][layer] for details on using [`Layer`]s.
//!
//! In addition, the [`Filter`] trait defines an interface for filtering what
//! spans and events are recorded by a particular layer. This allows different
//! [`Layer`]s to handle separate subsets of the trace data emitted by a
//! program. See the [documentation on per-layer filtering][plf] for more
//! information on using [`Filter`]s.

//!
//! ## Included Subscribers
//!
//! The following `Subscriber`s are provided for application authors:
//!
//! - [`fmt`] - Formats and logs tracing data (requires the `fmt` feature flag)
//!
//! ## Feature Flags
//!
//! - `std`: Enables APIs that depend on the on the Rust standard library
//!   (enabled by default).
//! - `alloc`: Depend on [`liballoc`] (enabled by "std").
//! - `env-filter`: Enables the [`EnvFilter`] type, which implements filtering
//!   similar to the [`env_logger` crate]. **Requires "std"**.
//! - `fmt`: Enables the [`fmt`] module, which provides a subscriber
//!   implementation for printing formatted representations of trace events.
//!   Enabled by default. **Requires "std"**.
//! - `ansi`: Enables `fmt` support for ANSI terminal colors. Enabled by
//!   default.
//! - `registry`: enables the [`registry`] module. Enabled by default.
//!   **Requires "std"**.
//! - `json`: Enables `fmt` support for JSON output. In JSON output, the ANSI
//!   feature does nothing. **Requires "fmt" and "std"**.
//! - [`local-time`]: Enables local time formatting when using the [`time`
//!   crate]'s timestamp formatters with the `fmt` subscriber.
//!
//! ### Optional Dependencies
//!
//! - [`tracing-log`]: Enables better formatting for events emitted by `log`
//!   macros in the `fmt` subscriber. Enabled by default.
//! - [`time`][`time` crate]: Enables support for using the [`time` crate] for timestamp
//!   formatting in the `fmt` subscriber.
//! - [`smallvec`]: Causes the `EnvFilter` type to use the `smallvec` crate (rather
//!   than `Vec`) as a performance optimization. Enabled by default.
//! - [`parking_lot`]: Use the `parking_lot` crate's `RwLock` implementation
//!   rather than the Rust standard library's implementation.
//!
//! ### `no_std` Support
//!
//! In embedded systems and other bare-metal applications, `tracing` can be
//! used without requiring the Rust standard library, although some features are
//! disabled. Although most of the APIs provided by `tracing-subscriber`, such
//! as [`fmt`] and [`EnvFilter`], require the standard library, some
//! functionality, such as the [`Subscriber`] trait, can still be used in
//! `no_std` environments.
//!
//! The dependency on the standard library is controlled by two crate feature
//! flags, "std", which enables the dependency on [`libstd`], and "alloc", which
//! enables the dependency on [`liballoc`] (and is enabled by the "std"
//! feature). These features are enabled by default, but `no_std` users can
//! disable them using:
//!
//! ```toml
//! # Cargo.toml
//! tracing-subscriber = { version = "0.3", default-features = false }
//! ```
//!
//! Additional APIs are available when [`liballoc`] is available. To enable
//! `liballoc` but not `std`, use:
//!
//! ```toml
//! # Cargo.toml
//! tracing-subscriber = { version = "0.3", default-features = false, features = ["alloc"] }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Supported Rust Versions
//!
//! Tracing is built against the latest stable release. The minimum supported
//! version is 1.42. The current Tracing version is not guaranteed to build on
//! Rust versions earlier than the minimum supported version.
//!
//! Tracing follows the same compiler support policies as the rest of the Tokio
//! project. The current stable Rust compiler and the three most recent minor
//! versions before it will always be supported. For example, if the current
//! stable compiler version is 1.45, the minimum supported version will not be
//! increased past 1.42, three minor versions prior. Increasing the minimum
//! supported compiler version is not considered a semver breaking change as
//! long as doing so complies with this policy.
