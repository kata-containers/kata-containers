  by the proc-macros. Add doc strings to generated static caches. Link to relevant static
  caches in generated function definitions. Add documentation to the generated
  cache-priming function.
## Changed

## Removed

## [0.28.0]
## Added

## Changed
## Removed

## [0.27.0] / [cached_proc_macro[0.8.0]]
## Added
- Add `time_refresh` option to `#[cached]` to refresh TTLs on cache hits
- Generate `*_prime_cache` functions for every `#[cached]` and `#[once]` function
  to allow priming caches.
## Changed
## Removed

## [0.26.1] / [cached_proc_macro[0.7.1]]
## Added
- Add `sync_writes` option to `#[cached]` macro to synchronize
  concurrent function calls of duplicate arguments. For ex, if
  a long running `#[cached(sync_writes = true)]` function is called
  several times concurrently, the actual function is only executed
  once while all other calls block and return the newly cached value.
## Changed
## Removed

## [0.26.0] / [cached_proc_macro[0.7.0]]
## Added
- Add `#[once]` macro for create a `RwLock` cache wrapping a single value
- For all caches, add a function to get an immutable reference to their
  contents. This makes it possible to manually dump a cache, so its contents
  can be saved and restored later.
