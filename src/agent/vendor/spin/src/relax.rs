/// A strategy that rapidly spins while informing the CPU that it should power down non-essential components via
/// [`core::hint::spin_loop`].
///
/// Note that spinning is a 'dumb' strategy and most schedulers cannot correctly differentiate it from useful work,
/// thereby misallocating even more CPU time to the spinning process. This is known as
/// ['priority inversion'](https://matklad.github.io/2020/01/02/spinlocks-considered-harmful.html).
///
/// If you see signs that priority inversion is occurring, consider switching to [`Yield`] or, even better, not using a
/// spinlock at all and opting for a proper scheduler-aware lock. Remember also that different targets, operating
/// systems, schedulers, and even the same scheduler with different workloads will exhibit different behaviour. Just
/// because priority inversion isn't occurring in your tests does not mean that it will not occur. Use a scheduler-
/// aware lock if at all possible.
