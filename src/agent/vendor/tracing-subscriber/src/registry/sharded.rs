/// A shared, reusable store for spans.
///
/// A `Registry` is a [`Subscriber`] around which multiple [`Layer`]s
/// implementing various behaviors may be [added]. Unlike other types
/// implementing `Subscriber`, `Registry` does not actually record traces itself:
/// instead, it collects and stores span data that is exposed to any [`Layer`]s
/// wrapping it through implementations of the [`LookupSpan`] trait.
/// The `Registry` is responsible for storing span metadata, recording
/// relationships between spans, and tracking which spans are active and which
/// are closed. In addition, it provides a mechanism for [`Layer`]s to store
/// user-defined per-span data, called [extensions], in the registry. This
/// allows [`Layer`]-specific data to benefit from the `Registry`'s
/// high-performance concurrent storage.
///
/// This registry is implemented using a [lock-free sharded slab][slab], and is
/// highly optimized for concurrent access.
///
/// # Span ID Generation
///
/// Span IDs are not globally unique, but the registry ensures that
/// no two currently active spans have the same ID within a process.
///
/// One of the primary responsibilities of the registry is to generate [span
/// IDs]. Therefore, it's important for other code that interacts with the
/// registry, such as [`Layer`]s, to understand the guarantees of the
/// span IDs that are generated.
///
/// The registry's span IDs are guaranteed to be unique **at a given point
/// in time**. This means that an active span will never be assigned the
/// same ID as another **currently active** span. However, the registry
/// **will** eventually reuse the IDs of [closed] spans, although an ID
/// will never be reassigned immediately after a span has closed.
///
/// Spans are not [considered closed] by the `Registry` until *every*
/// [`Span`] reference with that ID has been dropped.
///
/// Thus: span IDs generated by the registry should be considered unique
/// only at a given point in time, and only relative to other spans
/// generated by the same process. Two spans with the same ID will not exist
/// in the same process concurrently. However, if historical span data is
/// being stored, the same ID may occur for multiple spans times in that
/// data. If spans must be uniquely identified in historical data, the user
/// code storing this data must assign its own unique identifiers to those
/// spans. A counter is generally sufficient for this.
///
/// Similarly, span IDs generated by the registry are not unique outside of
/// a given process. Distributed tracing systems may require identifiers
/// that are unique across multiple processes on multiple machines (for
/// example, [OpenTelemetry's `SpanId`s and `TraceId`s][ot]). `tracing` span
/// IDs generated by the registry should **not** be used for this purpose.
/// Instead, code which integrates with a distributed tracing system should
/// generate and propagate its own IDs according to the rules specified by
/// the distributed tracing system. These IDs can be associated with
/// `tracing` spans using [fields] and/or [stored span data].
