Use this library to open a path or URL using the program configured on the system. It is equivalent to running one of the following:

```bash
# macOS
$ open <path-or-url>
# Windows
$ start <path-or-url>
# Linux
$ xdg-open <path-or-url> || gio open <path-or-url> || gnome-open <path-or-url> || kde-open <path-or-url> || wslview <path-or-url>
```

# Usage

Add this to your Cargo.toml
```toml
[dependencies]
open = "3"
```
…and open something using…
```Rust
open::that("https://rust-lang.org");
```

…or, open something with an application of your choice
```Rust
open::with("https://rust-lang.org", "firefox");
```

# Credits

The implementation is based on the respective functionality of [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo), but was improved to allow some error handling.
