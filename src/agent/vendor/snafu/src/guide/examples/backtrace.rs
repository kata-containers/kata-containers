use crate::{Snafu, Backtrace, ErrorCompat, GenerateImplicitData};

/// Backtraces aren't yet supported by the stable Rust compiler. SNAFU
/// provides a stable-compatible way of getting backtraces as well as
/// support for the backtrace support in the nightly compiler. **By
/// default, backtraces are disabled**. It is
/// expected that the final executable adds SNAFU as a dependency and
/// chooses the appropriate [feature
/// flag](crate::guide::feature_flags) to enable backtraces.
///
/// When using SNAFU to define error types, it's recommended to start
/// with a [`Backtrace`] field on every leaf error variant (those
/// without a `source`). Backtraces are only captured on
/// failure. Since backtraces are disabled by default, adding them in
/// a library does not force any users to pay the price of backtraces
/// if they are not used; they can be zero cost.
///
/// Certain errors are used for flow control. Those don't need a
/// backtrace as they don't represent actual failures. However,
/// sometimes an error is *mostly* used for flow control but might
/// also indicate an error. In those cases, you can use
/// `Option<Backtrace>` to avoid capturing a backtrace unless an
/// environment variable is set by the end user to provide additional
/// debugging.
///
/// For variants that do have a source, you need to evaluate if the
/// source error provides a backtrace of some kind. If it is another
/// SNAFU error, for example, you can *delegate* retrieval of the
/// backtrace to the source error. If the source error doesn't provide
/// its own backtrace, you should capture your own backtrace. This
/// backtrace would not be as useful as one captured by the source
/// error, but it's as useful as you can get.
///
/// When you wish to display the backtrace of an error, you can use
/// the [`ErrorCompat::backtrace`] method. It's recommended to always
/// use this in the fully-qualified form so it will be easy to find
/// and replace when Rust stabilizes backtraces.
