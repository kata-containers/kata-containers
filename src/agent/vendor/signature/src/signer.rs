///
/// ## Notes
///
/// This trait is primarily intended for signature algorithms based on the
/// [Fiat-Shamir heuristic], a method for converting an interactive
/// challenge/response-based proof-of-knowledge protocol into an offline
/// digital signature through the use of a random oracle, i.e. a digest
/// function.
///
/// The security of such protocols critically rests upon the inability of
/// an attacker to solve for the output of the random oracle, as generally
/// otherwise such signature algorithms are a system of linear equations and
/// therefore doing so would allow the attacker to trivially forge signatures.
///
/// To prevent misuse which would potentially allow this to be possible, this
/// API accepts a [`Digest`] instance, rather than a raw digest value.
///
/// [Fiat-Shamir heuristic]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat%E2%80%93Shamir_heuristic
