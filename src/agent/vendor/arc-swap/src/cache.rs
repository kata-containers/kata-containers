/// Generalization of caches providing access to `T`.
///
/// This abstracts over all kinds of caches that can provide a cheap access to values of type `T`.
/// This is useful in cases where some code doesn't care if the `T` is the whole structure or just
/// a part of it.
///
/// See the example at [`Cache::map`].
pub trait Access<T> {
    /// Loads the value from cache.
    ///
    /// This revalidates the value in the cache, then provides the access to the cached value.
    fn load(&mut self) -> &T;
}

/// Caching handle for [`ArcSwapAny`][ArcSwapAny].
///
/// Instead of loading the [`Arc`][Arc] on every request from the shared storage, this keeps
/// another copy inside itself. Upon request it only cheaply revalidates it is up to
/// date. If it is, access is significantly faster. If it is stale, the [load_full] is done and the
/// cache value is replaced. Under a read-heavy loads, the measured speedup are 10-25 times,
/// depending on the architecture.
///
/// There are, however, downsides:
///
/// * The handle needs to be kept around by the caller (usually, one per thread). This is fine if
///   there's one global `ArcSwapAny`, but starts being tricky with eg. data structures build from
///   them.
/// * As it keeps a copy of the [Arc] inside the cache, the old value may be kept alive for longer
///   period of time ‒ it is replaced by the new value on [load][Cache::load]. You may not want to
///   use this if dropping the old value in timely manner is important (possibly because of
///   releasing large amount of RAM or because of closing file handles).
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust
/// # fn do_something<V>(_v: V) { }
/// use std::sync::Arc;
///
/// use arc_swap::{ArcSwap, Cache};
///
/// let shared = Arc::new(ArcSwap::from_pointee(42));
/// // Start 10 worker threads...
/// for _ in 0..10 {
///     let mut cache = Cache::new(Arc::clone(&shared));
///     std::thread::spawn(move || {
