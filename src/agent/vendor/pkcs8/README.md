Private-Key Information Syntax Specification ([RFC 5208]).

## About PKCS#8

PKCS#8 is a format for cryptographic private keys, often containing pairs
of private and public keys.

You can identify a PKCS#8 private key encoded as PEM (i.e. text) by the
following:

```text
-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
```

PKCS#8 private keys can optionally be encrypted under a password using
key derivation algorithms like PBKDF2 and [scrypt], and encrypted with
ciphers like AES-CBC. When a PKCS#8 private key has been encrypted,
it starts with the following:

```text
-----BEGIN ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY-----
```

PKCS#8 private keys can also be serialized in an ASN.1-based binary format.
The PEM text encoding is a Base64 representation of this format.

## Supported Algorithms

This crate is implemented in an algorithm-agnostic manner with the goal of
enabling PKCS#8 support for any algorithm.

That said, it has been tested for interoperability against keys generated by
OpenSSL for the  following algorithms:

- ECC (`id-ecPublicKey`)
- Ed25519 (`id-Ed25519`)
- RSA (`id-rsaEncryption`)
- X25519 (`id-X25519`)

Please open an issue if you encounter trouble using it with a particular
algorithm, including the ones listed above or other algorithms.

## Minimum Supported Rust Version

This crate requires **Rust 1.56** at a minimum.

We may change the MSRV in the future, but it will be accompanied by a minor
version bump.
