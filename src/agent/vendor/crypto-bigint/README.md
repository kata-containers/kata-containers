Pure Rust implementation of a big integer library which has been designed from
the ground-up for use in cryptographic applications.

Provides constant-time, `no_std`-friendly implementations of modern formulas
using const generics.

[Documentation][docs-link]

## Goals

- No heap allocations. `no_std`-friendly.
- Constant-time by default. Variable-time functions are explicitly marked as such.
- Leverage what is possible today with const generics on `stable` rust.
- Support `const fn` as much as possible, including decoding big integers from
  bytes/hex and performing arithmetic operations on them, with the goal of
  being able to compute values at compile-time.

## Minimum Supported Rust Version

**Rust 1.56** at a minimum.
