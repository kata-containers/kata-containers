#     ***NOTE: This feature has been deprecated with plans to remove this
#     feature in the future. Please use other network models listed below.
#
#
#   - macvtap
#     Used when the Container network interface can be bridged using
#     macvtap.
#
#   - none
#     Used when customize network. Only creates a tap device. No veth pair.
#
#   - tcfilter
#     Uses tc filter rules to redirect traffic from the network interface
#     provided by plugin to a tap interface connected to the VM.
