# VFIO Mode
# Determines how VFIO devices should be be presented to the container.
# Options:
#
#  - vfio
#    Matches behaviour of OCI runtimes (e.g. runc) as much as

#    character devices under /dev/vfio.  The exact names may differ
#    from the host (they need to match the VM's IOMMU group numbers
#    rather than the host's)
#
#  - guest-kernel
#    This is a Kata-specific behaviour that's useful in certain cases.
#    The VFIO device is managed by whatever driver in the VM kernel
#    claims it.  This means it will appear as one or more device nodes
#    or network interfaces depending on the nature of the device.
#    Using this mode requires specially built workloads that know how
#    to locate the relevant device interfaces within the VM.

# which method to use in order to fetch the keys.
#
# Keys can be stored in a local file, in a measured and attested initrd:
#provision=data:///local/key/file

# Keys could be fetched through a special command or binary from the
