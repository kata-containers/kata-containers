# Kata Containers image generation #

A Kata Containers image is generated by the script `image_builder.sh`
which uses a `rootfs` directory created by the script
`rootfs-builder/rootfs.sh`.

To create a guest OS image run:

```
$ ./image_builder.sh path/to/rootfs
```

Where `path/to/rootfs` is the directory pupulated by `rootfs.sh`. The
script will check for following required binaries:

- `/sbin/init` : The image must contain a `init` binary 
- `/bin/kata-agent` : The image contain the Kata [agent]

More information about usage:

```
$ ./image_builder.sh -h
```
